<h2> Apriori Algorithm </h2>
Apriori algorithm is an algorithm that is typically run on shopping basket data to generate rules about sets of items and their relation to each other - namely deriving 3 values called Support, Lift and Confidence from the sets of items. One such example is that a large chain finding a correlation between two unseemingly related items - beer bottles and diapers - which were often bought together. From here a business could aim to change a strategy to further capitalise on this correlation, such as physically placing the two items closer together, or by bundling the two items together and offering a discount (although this may seem a bit taboo).

Support defines how often an item appears in a set whilst confidence is a measure of how often the rule is found to be true. Lift is generated from both the support and confidence value.
